## 🧠 Architectural Mental Model

### Core Responsibility
This is a **Sandbox Console Application** used for manually testing the Review System API integration (specifically `ICustomerFeedbackService`).

### Status
-   **Context**: Contains hardcoded IDs (`businessId = 34700`) and commented-out method calls.
-   **Usage**: Developers likely uncomment lines here to trigger a real API call to the Review System provider (e.g., ReviewPush) during development, rather than waiting for the background job.
